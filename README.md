# Dotfiles

These are the config files I used on most of my systems, YMMV

Ideas for how to manage it all shamelessly stolen from:

This should always be considered a work-in-progress, and never
really complete!

## Usage
1. Generate new SSH keys and add them to github
2. Clone this repository
3. Run `bootstrap.sh` to install everything
   1. If you only want certain things, just run `setup.sh` for each thing you want
